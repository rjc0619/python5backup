#Conclusion 1. blocks of code represent the indentations of what happens if the stament is ture or false just like MIT app inventor.

#Conclusion 3. Kendra is correct because I think that she was right when she said that it would take up less memory. I think Jayla is right in some forms because she talks about how you only have to change it in one spot. And finaly I disagree with Ira because I dont think the two lines would slow down the code.
